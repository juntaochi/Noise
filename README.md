## Overview  
Noise is a personalized soundscape creator built using SwiftUI and other native iOS frameworks. This app allows users to relax, focus, or enhance their environment through a diverse library of natural sounds. Each sound can be customized with adjustable intensity, while dynamic abstract visuals complement the auditory experience, creating a harmonious blend of sound and art.
